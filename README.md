# Cozi - Letter Exchange with Strangers

A CRUD website built with MERN Stack The main purpose of this website is to allow people to share their feelings, send them to the world, and find someone who empathizes with those feelings.

## About

This website was created during a contest in which I participated. I am currently developing a better version of this website in a private repository. The code for the public one from the contest may be found here:
